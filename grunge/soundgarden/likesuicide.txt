Heard it from another room
Eyes were waking up just to fall asleep
Love's like suicide
Dazed out in a garden bed
With a broken neck lays my broken gift
Just like suicide
You're my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her
Oh, to finish her
She lived like a murder, how she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder, but she died
Just like suicide
Bit down on the bullet now, I had a taste so sour
Had to think of something sweet
Love's like suicide
Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain, I wield a ton of rage
Just like suicide, hmm
With eyes of blood
And bitter blue, hmm-mmm
How I feel for you
I feel for you
She lived like a murder, how she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder, but she died
Just like suicide
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Yeah, lent to finish her
Oh, to finish her
With eyes of blood and bitter blue
How I feel for you
Yeah, I feel for you
I feel for you
Yeah, I feel for you
I feel, oh, hmm
I feel for you, yeah, yeah, hmm, yeah
Oh, oh, feel
Oh, feel, feel
Oh-yeah, oh, oh-yeah, feel
She lived like a murder, how she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder, but she died
Just like suicide
