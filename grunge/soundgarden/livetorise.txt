Live To Rise
Soundgarden

What if all you understand could fit into the center of a hand?
Then you found that wasn't you
Who held the sum of everything you knew

We're insane but not alone, we hold on and let go

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun, we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again

What if the one thing that I missed
Was everything I need to pass the test?
And if I fail what happens then?
Can I still count on you as a friend?

We're insane but not alone, we hold on and let go

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun, we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun, we will live to rise again

Warm my face, warm your face
Warm my face, warm your face
Warm my face, warm your face
Warm my face, warm your face
Warm my face, warm your face

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun, we will live and die
And then ignite again

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun, we will live and die
And then ignite again

Like the sun, we will live to rise again
